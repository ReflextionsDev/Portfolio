# Showcase div height should be dynamic according to navbar height, which should load off variable. Not sure of the best way to do this. Some options:
- Svelte store for var
- Pass height var to child
- CSS tricks?
- CSS superset

# Phone
- Only show fullscreen on hover
- Click images to bring up full sized modal

# Background
- Blur not supported on FF, preview page without blur effects, fix issues:
  - Fill not displaying
  - Background blue mask not showing
- Pre-blur background instead
